### Hey there, I'm [Frank](https://frankzliu.com) ðŸ‘‹

Professional presser of computer buttons, currently at [Voyage AI](https://voyageai.com). Feel free to connect with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/frankzliu) or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/fzliu).

Some stuff I'm working on:
- [`retrieval`](https://github.com/fzliu/retrieval-toolbox): A suite of tools designed to help build search/retrieval systems atop Voyage embedding models and rerankers.
- [`radient`](https://github.com/fzliu/radient): Turns many data types (not just text) into vectors for similarity search, RAG, regression analysis, and more.
